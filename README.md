# CalculatorGUI
A program that creates a calculator using GUIs.
This was the final assignment in the CSC142 Computer Science 2 course I took at West Chester University. Utilizing GUIs I was tasked with creating a working calculator that could perform basic arithmetic as well as trig functions. I received a 100% on this project.
